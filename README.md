# BlueTeam-RespondersUnite_SCDFXIBM
We are coders who aspire to make a difference and here is our attempt at doing so. ☺️

## Overview

We decided to tackle the first problem *Emergency Medical Services*. Specifically, we propose to enhance SCDF's myResponder application to further empower CFRs (Community First Responders). 

Our application *Responders Unite* is not only a platform that seeks to **bring individual CFRs together**, but also a smart application that **alerts them of potential accidents** that warrant their attention, **provides them with relevant information** that facilitates faster response, and **eases the collaboration between CFRs and SCDF**.

To make the above a reality, we propose to
* create a forum for individuals living in the same region to share their ideas, thoughts and tips
* harness the power of machine intelligence (specifically, the artificial recurrent neural network architecture *Long short-term memory*) and internet of things for the prediction of possible accidents that might otherwise go unnoticed
* utilise data analytics for the detection of vulnerable groups of individuals, which can, in turn, heighten the alertness of CFRs, enabling them to respond more quickly when an accident occurs
* implement a chatbot that helps SCDF to gather more relevant information from CFRs in times of emergency
